Modules

We've now undertood what it means to be a torsor over 
a group. A concrete example is our torsor of triangles 
over a group of rotational symmetries. That fact that
rotational symmetries form an additive group lets us 
do *additive group math* on symmetries: associative add, 
additively invert, subtract, zero left/right identity. 

In this chapter, we strengthen this concept by upgrading 
a mere additive group of actions/differences to a *module* 
of actions. In comparison with a group, G, a module adds a
set of scalars and an operation for multiplying group 
actions by scalars. 

For example, if s is a scalar and v is a group action,
then s • v is scalar multiplication of s and v yielding a
new, "scaled" group action. 

The set of scalars must form at least a *ring*, so you 
can add, invert, substract, and multiply scalars by each 
other (+, -, *). For example, the integers for a ring: 
you can multiply, add, invert, and thus subtract them,
but dividing them generally doesn't produce new integers.

If sclars have multiplicative inverses as well, and thus 
division, then you have a scalar *field*. For example, the
set of real numbers minus {0} forms a field. A module with
a scalar *field* is called a vector space.

The overall picture, then, is one in which, in a module, 
you can not only add, invert, and substract actions, but
you can also multiply (*scale*) them by scalars. Example:
if v₁ and v₂ are group actions and s₁ and s₂ are scalars,
then s₁ • (v1 +ᵥ v2) is also an action, s₁ • v₁ + s₁ • v₂; 
and (s₁ + s₂) • v1 = s• v₁ + s₁ • v₂, is too. A module is
a generalization of a vector space where you can't always 
compute inverses of scalars. 

Once we have modules, as richer sets of group actions, then
we'll be able to form torsors over *modules*. That takes us
right right up to the threshold of affine spaces, which are
simply torsors over *vector* spaces. Vector spaces are just
modules with that extra structure on their sets of scalars.


Modules in Lean
---------------

In Lean, one can form a module from an *additive commutative 
monoid* M, and a *semi-ring,* R, of scalars. A module relaxes
the need for an underlying *group* of actions by relaxing the
need for additive inverses of actions. And unlike a full ring, 
a semi-ring omits the requirement for additive inverses (and
thus subtraction) of scalars. 

Note that in a ring, the existence of additive inverses means
that 0 is a multiplicative zero (prove it to yourself); in a 
semi-ring, by contrast, without additive inverses, one has to
identify the multiplicative zero explicitly (and show that it
is one).

Example
-------

Can we turn our group of triangle rotations into a module?
What would we need? Answer: a ring of scalars and a scalar
multiplication operation. What would be a good scalar ring?
How about the integers? They do form a ring, though not a
field, as discussed. If we have a rotation action, g, and 
an integer scalar r, how would we define the scalar product,
r • g? It needs to be another action. How about the action
that simply applies g r times?
